        <h3>Happy 3 months my baby</h3>

        <p>
          I just want to thank you for the best three months of my life, you bring me
          so much joy and I love you so much. Meeting you was the best thing that ever
          happened to me, thank you for making me believe that true love actually exists
          and that soulmates are a real thing and not fictional.
          <br><br>
          I couldn’t ask for anything or anyone better. Thank you for showing me what
          an ideal relationship looks like. I remember telling you that I used to ask
          bhai how do uk if a person is the one and he used to say “U’ll just know”.
          That was the biggest bullshit I had heard till I met you baby.
          <br><br>
          I instantly knew you were the one. You became the friend that I always wished
          I had and with time you became much more than that. No one’s presence calms me
          like urs, no one’s smile makes me grin except yours.
          <br><br>
          I’ve fallen — badly — but for the right one. Thank you for always being there
          for me and keeping up with stupid dramas of mine. I get to be myself with you.
          I love being around you even if we are doing nothing, it makes me feel complete
          and comforting.
          <br><br>
          Always be mine man cz ur stuck for life and I hope I always keep you happy.
          I promise I will never be the reason u get sad everr.
          <br><br>
          I love u 4eva and eva and eva &lt;33
