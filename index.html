      <h3>Happy 3 months my baby</h3>
      <p>
        I just want to thank you for the best three months of my life, you bring me so much joy and I love you so much.
        Meeting you was the best thing that ever happened to me, thank you for making me believe that true love actually exists
        and that soulmates are a real thing and not fictional, I couldn't ask for anything or anyone better.
        thank you for showing me what an ideal relationship looks like, I remember telling you that I used to ask bhai
        how do uk if a person is the one and he used to say "U'll just know", that was the biggest bullshit I had heard
        till I met you baby, I instantly knew you were the one, you became the friend that I always wished I had and with time
        u became much more than that, no one's presence calms me like urs, no one's smile makes me grin except yours,
        I've fallen and that too bad but for the right one, thank you for always being there for me and keeping up w stupid dramas
        of mine, I get to be myself w u man, I love being around you even if we are doing nothing it makes me feel so complete
        and comforting, always be mine man cz ur stuck for life and I hope I always keep you happy,
        I promise I will never be the reason u get sad everr, cz I love u 4eva and eva and eva&lt;33
